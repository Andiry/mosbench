Derived from a sequential version of searchy (Jinyang Li's search engine)

mkdb.conf is as in searchy

To create the indices:

   mkdir /dev/tmp/db0
   mkdir /dev/tmp/db1
   ./mkdb/pedsort -t /tmp/db/db -c 2 -m 1024 < files

where files contains a pathname for a file to be indexed per line

To query the indices:

   ./query/qe -t /tmp/db/db -q "main" -c 2  -l
